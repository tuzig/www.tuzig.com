The boyscout rule is a simple rule that can be applied to many aspects of life. It is a simple rule that says: "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it". It's probably the best way to keep a common space clean and tidy. It's also a great way to keep a software project clean and tidy.

It breaks down to a simple principle: if you see something that is not right, fix it.
If you see a piece of code that is not up to par,
you should take the time to clean it up.
If a comment is confusing, it should removed or improved.
If a tool or process should be improved, do it and if it leads to a rabbit hole, open a ticket.

Adopting the rule is not easy. It requires a change in the culture;
instead of moving fast and breaking things, the team should move fast and fix things. 
As a first step, leadership should acknowledge that the debt is there and that cleaning takes time.
Then code reviewers can keep the boyscout rule in mind, taking the time to suggest ways to clean the code. 

Encouraging the rule will instill a sense of ownership and responsibility in the team.
This will change their PoV and technical debt will start hurting their eyes. 
Cleaning will become a habit and technical debt interest will be at a minimum.
