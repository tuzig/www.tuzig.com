I'm just back from a great Open Knesset meetup. There were seven of us, a pool table and lots of free goldstar beer (thanks to amir from goldstar) in the "Rosa Parks". It was great fun.

We came to play with planning. Our project, [Open-Knesset](http://www.oknesset.org/), needs focus and the game delivered. We started with the [wiki definition](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PlanningGame), the ideas of [AgileZen](http://agilezen.com/tour/visualize) and a pool table.

As the game progressed the table filled with cards. Well, the left side did, the right was left empty, opening room for [empty thoughts](http://michaeltrier.com/).We decided to split: keep what's critical above the stick and what's important below it.

We left the table when we had our prime objective: Make our user go wow! and how to do it - serving a page that renders a glance at a Knesset Member. We cleared the table and focused on the information displayed on the member's page. At that time, someone wanted to play pool, so we moved to a side table, opened one laptop with balsamiq and wireframed the page.

I had no idea it would end there, a pleasant surprise.
