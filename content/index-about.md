Led by [Benny Daon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daonb), our services are focused on  making developers happy while developing better code, tests and docs.

## Our Beliefs

- Software age faster than we think
- Happy developers write better code
- Technical debt dampens team spirit and code quality
- Quality is an emergent property and can't be controlled directly
