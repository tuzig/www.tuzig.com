<p>The Internet Network</font></b> </p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua">Internet network parameters are constantly changing. The way
the Internet behaves doesn't conform to any known statistical rule. To illustrate these
fluctuations one need only monitor the bandwidth available to a single connection and how
it changes throughout the day.</font> </p>

<p><b><font FACE="Book Antiqua">Simulating The Internet</font></b> </p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua">The ideal way to simulate the Internet is to record the
actual Internet performance and use this recording as a basis for the simulation thereby
eliminating statistical extrapolations. The Cloud simulates the Internet using this Record
&amp; Playback mechanism.</font> </p>

<p><b><font FACE="Book Antiqua">Network Recording Files</font></b> </p>

<p><font FACE="Book Antiqua">Playback dynamics are based on actual network Recording
files. To create these recordings the user specifies the destination IP address or URL
(Uniform Resource Locator) and the time scale. The Cloud recording module then accesses
the network, and records the actual performance dynamically. The result is a latency over
time graph as shown in the example below:</font> </p>
<div align="center"><center>

<table BORDER="0">
  <tr>
    <td><font FACE="Book Antiqua">After the recording process is completed, the file can then
    be used by the simulator to recreate the WAN latency conditions locally as if it were the
    real WAN connection that was previously recorded.</font></td>
